# clj-snake

An implementation of the game *snake* written in Clojure with a GUI written in [Seesaw](https://github.com/daveray/seesaw). Based on the snake example given in [Programming Clojure](https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure), but with some improvements and using Seesaw for the GUI instead of Swing.

I couldn't find many game examples using Seesaw on the web so I put this up as a demo that some clojure beginners may find instructive.

## Usage

    $ lein compile
    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar clj-snake-0.1.0.jar [args]
